## ðŸ“… Week 1 - Day 1: Introduction to Databases & SQL

ðŸ”¥ Database :
A database is a structured collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. It stores data in a way that makes it easy to retrieve and manipulate.
- Relational databases store data in tables (rows and columns).
Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle, SQL Server.

ðŸ“Œ Types of Databases :
1. Relational Databases (RDBMS) :Store data in tables (rows & columns).
- Use SQL for querying and managing data.
Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle, SQL Server

2. NoSQL Databases: Store unstructured or semi-structured data.
- Flexible schema, great for big data and real-time apps.
- Types: Document, Key-Value, Graph, Column
Examples: MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra, Neo4j

3. NewSQL Databases: Combine the reliability of SQL with the scalability of NoSQL.
- Good for distributed systems.
Examples: Google Spanner, CockroachDB

4. Time-Series Databases :Optimized for handling time-stamped data (e.g., logs, metrics).
Examples: InfluxDB, TimescaleDB

5. Object-Oriented Databases :Store data as objects, like in object-oriented programming.
Less common but used in specific applications.

ðŸ”¥SQL :
SQL (Structured Query Language) is the language used to communicate with relational databases.
You use SQL to:
- Create and modify tables.
- Insert, update, delete data.
- Query data with filters and sorting.
- Manage users and permissions.

ðŸ“ŒPopular SQL Databases (RDBMS)
These are different systems that use SQL to manage relational databases. Each has its own features but follows similar SQL standards.

System      |   	Type              	              |     Best For
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MySQL       |   Open Source	Web apps,             |    General use
PostgreSQL  |  	Open Source	Advanced queries      |    Analytics
SQLite	     |   Open Source	Lightweight           |    Mobile apps
SQL Server  |  	Commercial                        |    Enterprise, Windows systems
Oracle      |  	Commercial	                       |    Large-scale enterprise apps
